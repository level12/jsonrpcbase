Intro
---------------

Simple JSON-RPC service without transport layer

This library is intended as an auxiliary library for easy an implementation of JSON-RPC services with Unix/TCP socket
like transport protocols that do not have complex special requirements. You need to utilize some suitable transport
protocol with this library to actually provide a working JSON-RPC service.

Features
---------

- Easy to use, small size, well tested.
- Supports JSON-RPC v2.0. Compatible with v1.x style calls with the exception of v1.0 class-hinting.
- Optional argument type validation that significantly eases development of jsonrpc method_data.

Example
--------

Example usage::

    import jsonrpcbase

    chat_service = jsonrpcbase.JSONRPCService()

    def login(username, password, timelimit=0):
        (...)
        return True

    def receive_message(**kwargs):
        (...)
        return chat_message

    def send_message(msg):
        (...)

    if __name__ == '__main__':

        # Adds the method login to the service as a 'login'.
        chat_service.add(login, types=[basestring, basestring, int])

        # Adds the method receive_message to the service as a 'recv_msg'.
        chat_service.add(receive_message, name='recv_msg', types={"msg": basestring, "id": int})

        # Adds the method send_message as a 'send_msg' to the service.
        chat_service.add(send_message, 'send_msg')

        (...)

        # Receive a JSON-RPC call.
        jsonmsg = my_socket.recv()

        # Process the JSON-RPC call.
        result = chat_service.call(jsonmsg)

        # Send back results.
        my_socket.send(result)

Current Status
---------------

Seems stable, but hasn't been widely used to my knowledge.

The `development version <https://github.com/level12/jsonrpcbase/archive/master.zip#egg=JSONRPCBase-dev>`_
is installable with ``easy_install JSONRPCBase==dev``.
