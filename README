The jsonrpcbase implements a simple JSON-RPC service with the exception of a transport layer.

This library is intended as an auxiliary library for easy an implementation of JSON-RPC services with Unix/TCP socket 
like transport protocols that do not have complex special requirements. You need to utilize some suitable transport 
protocol with this library to actually provide a working JSON-RPC service.

Features:
- Supports JSON-RPC v2.0. Compatible with v1.x style calls with the exception of v1.0 class-hinting.
- Easy to use.
- Small size.
- Well tested.

Example:

    import jsonrpcbase
    
    chat_service = jsonrpcbase.JSONRPCService()
    
    @chat_service()
    def login(username, password):
        (...)
        return True
    
    # Adds the method receive_message to the service as a 'recv_msg'.
    @chat_service('recv_msg')
    def receive_message(**kwargs):
        (...)
        return chat_message
    
    def send_message(msg):
        (...)
        
    if __name__ == '__main__':
    
        # Alternate way of adding remote methods
        # Add the method send_message as a 'send_msg' to the service.
        chat_service.add(send_message, 'send_msg')
        
        (...)
        
        # Receive a JSON-RPC call.
        jsonrpc_call = my_socket.recv()
        
        # Process the JSON-RPC call.
        result = chat_service.call(jsonrpc_call)
        
        # Send back results.
        my_socket.send(result)
